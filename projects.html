                <br>
                <br>
                Team Me is an energetic indie band with a Norwegian Grammy award and several radio hits on the CV.
                Since the first EP, released in 2011, I've been playing on most of the recordings, and in 2018 I became
                a permanent member of the live band as well.
                On stage I get to switch between my favorite instruments all the time, which fits me perfectly. Team Me
                has released several albums and EPs, and is touring all over Norway, Europe and Japan.

                <br>
                <br>
                Einar Stray Orchestra is my first proper band project. Since the small beginning in 2007, we
                have evolved from a bedroom indie solo project to a sometimes hard-hitting band with a sound that spans
                from classical music and post-rock, to prog and pop music.
                This is where I first started to experiment with sound, pedal effects and genres, and where I've
                fine-tuned the skill of playing cello, singing, and maneuvering pedals at the same time.
                ESO has also a long list of recordings, and is also touring all over Norway, Europe and worldwide.

                <strong>Solo project</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is kind of my own playground, where I get to use everything I like about different genres and
                sounds, and experiment with it in every way. The music usually ends up within a range from folk-inspired pop to
                contemporary music, with melodic, yet complex arrangements.
                I've played several solo concerts in Norway and Germany, and I'm planning on releasing some music within
                the next couple of years.
                <br>

                <br>
            <p id="misc"><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
            For some years, I collaborated with the Vietnamese activist and musician <a class="prosjekt-link" href="https://www.mai-khoi.com/" target="_blank">Mai Khoi</a> . 
            She is protesting the Vietnamese government and how they treat the Vietnamese people and artists.
            We worked together with her songs about her life and activism and played several shows in Oslo in 2019.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since 2017, I've been collaborating with the vocalist Julie Kleive in different constellations. We play both
            her own songs as well as cover songs, with completely new arrangements made by us.
            We've played many concerts around in Norway, usually together with Torfinn Kleive (piano). Every year, we also have a 
            Christmas concert in BÃ¦rum Kulturhus, right outisde of Oslo, in an ensemble consisting of Hilde FjerdingÃ¸y (melodeon),
            Torkjell Hovland (double bass), Torfinn Kleive, Julie Kleive and myself.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since 2020, I've been singing in and conducting a female choir called "IkvelderdetlovÃ¥vÃ¦rekoret". We
            sing folk tunes, popular music, and our own arrangements of various songs.
            We are mostly known for our collaboration with the artist Nils Bech, whom we sung with in the Oslo Opera
            House for a sold out Main Stage in the beginning of 2022, and at Oslo Pride 2022. More collaborations with artists will happen the next years.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since I started my professional career I've also been working both live and/or in the studio with bands and
            artists such as
            <br>
            Moddi, KrÃ¥kesÃ¸lv, Siv Jakobsen, Jakob, Nora Konstanse, Cold Mailman, Rikke Normann and Therese Aune, to name a few.

                <br>
                <br>
                I write music for sinfonietta, choirs, smaller ensembles in different constellations and solo pieces for
                piano, strings, and winds.
                My works are both completely acoustic and a combination of electronics and acoustics. The music often
                has a contemporary classical sound, but just as often a more folk and pop vibe.
                I can make new, commissioned music or arrangements for various constellations on demand, both for
                ensembles, solo instrumentalists or bands/artists who want "something extra" to their songs.
                <br>

                I'm a well experienced studio musician, and I enjoy working together with bands/artists/producers in the
                studio.
                <br>
                During the years, I've also built up my own home studio where I record a lot of music, both for myself
                and others.
                <br>
                I started out working with musical theatre this way, and I have both made, played and recorded music for
                full-length musicals in my own studio.

                I'm available for playing at most types of events, like weddings, funerals, conferences and so on.
                I have several constellations of ensembles, for any type of setting and musical preferences:
            <ul>
                <li>Solo performance (cello/piano/voice)</li>
                <li>Small ensemble (e.g., with more string players, guitar and/or another voice)</li>
                <li>Vocal ensemble (from trio to octet)</li>
                <li>Full band (with a long list of cover songs to choose from)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                <br>
                I started teaching music in 2004 and have since then had a great number of students. I give lessons in piano,
                cello and vocals from beginner to intermediate level, in all ages.
                <br>
                In addition to private lessons, I have more than ten years of experience teaching musical theatre for
                children, and four years of experience teaching music at a primary school.
                <br>
                It's important to me that the lessons are planned with each individual student's wishes and needs (and
                of course age) in mind, so no courses will be completely the same.
                <br>
                Each lesson/course can be adapted for the student, from the time frame of each lesson, to how often we
                have lessons and what we focus on in each lesson. I give lessons in Norwegian and English.
